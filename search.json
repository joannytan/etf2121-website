While Excel can be used for small datasets and simple calculations, a DBMS is a better choice for larger datasets and more complex data management needs. For example, in a large banking system, a DBMS would be used to manage customer accounts, transactions, and other data, while Excel might be used for simple reporting or analysis tasks. To deal with single large dataset, a DBMS is more efficient and effective than Excel. For example, a DBMS can handle millions of records and complex queries, while Excel may struggle with performance and data integrity issues. Also, when we need to joins multiple tables together, a DBMS provides powerful tools for managing relationships between tables, while Excel is limited in this regard. Imagine a bank store all the customers data in Excel, it would be very difficult to manage and retrieve the data efficiently. A DBMS would provide a more structured and efficient way to manage the data.",

Each table represents a specific entity or concept, and the columns represent the attributes or properties of that entity. The rows in the table represent individual records or instances of the entity. It allows for the establishment of relationships between different tables using keys, enabling complex data modeling and retrieval.

Each table has its own set of columns and rows, and the relationships between the tables are established using primary and foreign keys.

In this course, we will focus on using Oracle as our RDBMS. Oracle is chosen as it is widely used in the industry and provides a robust platform for learning SQL and database management concepts.\nSQL is a declarative language, meaning that users specify what they want to do with the data, rather than how to do it. This allows for more efficient and optimized execution of queries by the database engine.

The main DQL command is: - SELECT: Used to retrieve data from one or more tables in the database. - WHERE: Used to filter the results of a query based on specified conditions. - ORDER BY: Used to sort the results of a query in ascending or descending order - GROUP BY: Used to group the results of a query based on specified columns. - HAVING: Used to filter the results of a grouped query based on specified conditions - JOIN: Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. - UNION: Used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set. - DISTINCT: Used to retrieve unique values from a column, eliminating duplicate values. - LIMIT: Used to limit the number of rows returned by a query.\nAll these keywords will be explained in the next sections. 🔮",

    "text": "2.1 Creating a Table\nSQL follows a standard syntax for managing and manipulating relational databases. Below are some fundamental SQL commands and examples to help you get started.\nThe general structure of an SQL statement is as follows:\nThe select statement is used to retrieve data from a database, while the from clause specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. The where clause is optional and is used to filter the results based on a specified condition. These are SQL keywords and are not case-sensitive, but it is common practice to write them in uppercase for better readability. Also, they should end with a semicolon (;) to indicate the end of the statement.\nTo create a table in SQL, you can use the CREATE TABLE statement. Here is an example of how to create a simple table called Employees with columns for EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, and HireDate:",
