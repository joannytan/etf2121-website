    "text": "1.3 Why not Excel?\nExcel is a easy to use tool for data analysis and visualization, but it is not designed to be a full-fledged database management system. While Excel can be used for small datasets and simple calculations, a DBMS is a better choice for larger datasets and more complex data management needs. For example, in a large banking system, a DBMS would be used to manage customer accounts, transactions, and other data, while Excel might be used for simple reporting or analysis tasks. To deal with single large dataset, a DBMS is more efficient and effective than Excel. For example, a DBMS can handle millions of records and complex queries, while Excel may struggle with performance and data integrity issues. Also, when we need to joins multiple tables together, a DBMS provides powerful tools for managing relationships between tables, while Excel is limited in this regard. Imagine a bank store all the customers data in Excel, it would be very difficult to manage and retrieve the data efficiently. A DBMS would provide a more structured and efficient way to manage the data.",

Each table represents a specific entity or concept, and the columns represent the attributes or properties of that entity. The rows in the table represent individual records or instances of the entity. It allows for the establishment of relationships between different tables using keys, enabling complex data modeling and retrieval. Figure 1 illustrates a simple relational database with four tables: Drivers License, Member, Rental, Movie_Rental and Movie. Each table has its own set of columns and rows, and the relationships between the tables are established using primary and foreign keys. (we will cover keys later).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Simple Relational Database Example.\n\n\nsource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3icLzBtg8I",

It is used to perform various operations on the data stored in a database, such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data. SQL is widely used in the industry and is supported by most relational database management systems (RDBMS), including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. The standard language for different RDBMS may have slight variations, but the core SQL syntax and functionality remain consistent across platforms. In this course, we will focus on using Oracle as our RDBMS. Oracle is chosen as it is widely used in the industry and provides a robust platform for learning SQL and database management concepts.\nSQL is a declarative language, meaning that users specify what they want to do with the data, rather than how to do it. This allows for more efficient and optimized execution of queries by the database engine. SQL is also a powerful language that supports complex queries, joins, aggregations, and subqueries, making it suitable for a wide range of data analysis tasks.",

    "section": "2.2 SQL for Data Querying and Manipulation",
    "text": "2.2 SQL for Data Querying and Manipulation\nSQL is a powerful language for querying and manipulating data in relational databases. As a data analyst, you will frequently use SQL to extract insights from data stored in databases. In this section, we will cover some of the most commonly used SQL commands for data querying and manipulation.\n\n2.2.1 Selecting Data\nThe SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database. You can specify the columns you want to retrieve and the table from which to retrieve the data. The syntax for the SELECT statement is as follows:\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name;\nHere is an example of how to select specific columns from a table called Employees:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate\nFROM Employees;\n\n\n2.2.2 Filtering Data\nThe WHERE clause is used to filter the results based on a specified condition. Here is an example of how to select employees who were hired after January 1, 2020:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate\nFROM Employees\nWHERE HireDate &gt; '2020-01-01';\n\n\n2.2.3 Sorting Data\nThe ORDER BY clause is used to sort the results in ascending or descending order. Here is an example of how to select employees and sort them by their last name in ascending order:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate\nFROM Employees\nORDER BY LastName ASC;\n-- or in descending order\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate\nFROM Employees\nORDER BY LastName DESC;\n\n\n2.2.4 Distinct Values\nThe DISTINCT keyword is used to retrieve unique values from a column. Here is an example of how to select distinct job titles from a table called Jobs:\nSELECT DISTINCT JobTitle\nFROM Jobs;\n\n\n2.2.5 Multiple Conditions\nYou can use logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT to combine multiple conditions in the WHERE clause. The general syntax for using multiple conditions is as follows:\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name\nWHERE condition1 AND|OR condition2;\nHere is an example of how to select employees who were hired after January 1, 2020, and have a salary greater than 50000:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate, Salary\nFROM Employees\nWHERE HireDate &gt; '2020-01-01' AND Salary &gt; 50000;\nOr you can use OR operator as below:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate, Salary\nFROM Employees\nWHERE HireDate &gt; '2020-01-01' OR Salary &gt; 50000;\nThis SQL selects the FirstName, LastName, HireDate, and Salary of employees from the Employees table where the HireDate is after January 1, 2020, or the Salary is greater than 50000.\nThe NOT operator can be used to exclude certain records. Here is an example of how to select employees who do not work in the department with ID 3:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID\nFROM Employees\nWHERE NOT DepartmentID = 3;\n\n2.2.5.1 Exercises\n\nWrite a query to select all employees who work in the ‘IT’ department.\nWrite a query to select distinct job titles from the Jobs table.\nWrite a query to select employees with a salary between 40000 and 80000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n-- 1. Employees in 'IT' department\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID\nFROM Employees\nWHERE DepartmentID = (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE DepartmentName = 'IT');\n\n-- 2. Distinct job titles from Jobs table\nSELECT DISTINCT JobTitle\nFROM Jobs;\n\n-- 3. Employees with salary between 40000 and 80000\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary\nFROM Employees\nWHERE Salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 80000;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Aggregating Data\nSQL provides several aggregate functions that allow you to perform calculations on a set of values. Some commonly used aggregate functions include COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX(). Here is an example of how to count the number of employees in the Employees table:\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees\nFROM Employees;\nThis SQL selects the total number of employees from the Employees table and labels the result as NumberOfEmployees. * means all rows.\n-- Example of SUM function\nSELECT SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary\nFROM Employees;\nThis SQL selects the total sum of the Salary column from the Employees table and labels the result as TotalSalary.\n-- Example of AVG function\nSELECT AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary\nFROM Employees;\nThis SQL selects the average value of the Salary column from the Employees table and labels the result as AverageSalary.\n-- Example of MIN and MAX functions\nSELECT MIN(Salary) AS MinimumSalary, MAX(Salary) AS MaximumSalary\nFROM Employees;\nThis SQL selects the minimum and maximum values of the Salary column from the Employees table and labels the results as MinimumSalary and MaximumSalary, respectively.\n\n2.2.6.1 Exercises\n\nWrite a query to select all employees who were hired in the year 2021.\nWrite a query to select distinct locations from the Departments table.\nWrite a query to count the total number of employees.\nWrite a query to find the average salary of employees in the Employees table.\nWrite a query to select employees and sort them by their hire date in descending order.\nWrite a query to find the maximum and minimum hire dates from the Employees table.\nWrite a query to count the number of distinct job titles in the Jobs table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n-- 1. Employees hired in 2021\nSELECT *\nFROM Employees\nWHERE YEAR(HireDate) = 2021;\n\n-- 2. Distinct locations from Departments table\nSELECT DISTINCT Location\nFROM Departments;\n\n-- 3. Count number of employees in each department\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees\nFROM Employees;\n\n-- 4. Average salary of employees\nSELECT AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary\nFROM Employees;\n\n-- 5. Employees sorted by hire date in descending order\nSELECT *\nFROM Employees\nORDER BY HireDate DESC;\n\n-- 6. Maximum and minimum hire dates\nSELECT MIN(HireDate) AS MinimumHireDate, MAX(HireDate) AS MaximumHire\nFROM Employees;\n\n-- 7. Count of distinct job titles in Jobs table\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT JobTitle) AS NumberOfJobTitles\nFROM Jobs;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.7 WHERE Clause\nThe WHERE clause is used to filter records that meet a certain condition. It can be used with various comparison operators such as =, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, and logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT. The general syntax for the WHERE clause is as follows:\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name\nWHERE condition;\nHere is an example of how to use the WHERE clause to select employees with a salary greater than 50000:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary\nFROM Employees\nWHERE Salary &gt; 50000;\nThis SQL selects the FirstName, LastName, and Salary of employees from the Employees table where the Salary is greater than 50000.\n\n2.2.7.1 Exercises\n\nWrite a query to select employees who were hired before January 1, 2020.\nWrite a query to select employees with the job title ‘Manager’ and a salary greater than 60000.\nWrite a query to select employees who work in the ‘IT’ department or have a salary less than 40000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n-- 1. Employees hired before January 1, 2020\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate\nFROM Employees\nWHERE HireDate &lt; '2020-01-01';\n\n-- 2. Employees with job title 'Manager' and salary greater than 60000\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary\nFROM Employees\nWHERE JobTitle = 'Manager' AND Salary &gt; 60000;\n\n-- 3. Employees in 'IT' department or salary less than 40000\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID, Salary\nFROM Employees\nWHERE DepartmentID = (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE DepartmentName = 'IT') OR Salary &lt; 40000;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.8 GROUP BY Clause\nThe GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It is often used with aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group of data. The general syntax for the GROUP BY clause is as follows:\nSELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)\nFROM table_name\nGROUP BY column1;\nHere is an example of how to use the GROUP BY clause to count the number of employees in each department:\nSELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY DepartmentID;\nThis SQL selects the DepartmentID and counts the number of employees in each department from the Employees table, grouping the results by DepartmentID and labeling the count as NumberOfEmployees.\n\n2.2.8.1 Exercises\n\nWrite a query to find the total salary for each department.\nWrite a query to count the number of employees in each job title.\nWrite a query to find the average hire date for each department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n-- 1. Total salary for each department\nSELECT DepartmentID, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY DepartmentID;\n\n-- 2. Count of employees in each job title\nSELECT JobTitle, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY JobTitle;\n\n-- 3. Average hire date for each department\nSELECT DepartmentID, AVG(HireDate) AS AverageHireDate\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY DepartmentID;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.9 HAVING Clause\nThe HAVING clause is used to filter records that meet a certain condition after the GROUP BY clause has been applied. It is similar to the WHERE clause, but it is used for aggregated data. The general syntax for the HAVING clause is as follows:\nSELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)\nFROM table_name\nGROUP BY column1\nHAVING condition;\nHere is an example of how to use the HAVING clause to filter departments with more than 5 employees:\nSELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY DepartmentID\nHAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 5;\nThis SQL selects the DepartmentID and counts the number of employees in each department from the Employees table, grouping the results by DepartmentID and filtering to include only those departments with more than 5 employees.\n\n2.2.9.1 Exercises\n\nWrite a query to find departments with a total salary greater than 200000.\nWrite a query to find job titles with more than 10 employees.\nWrite a query to find departments with an average hire date before 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n-- 1. Departments with total salary greater than 200000\nSELECT DepartmentID, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY DepartmentID\nHAVING SUM(Salary) &gt; 200000;\n\n-- 2. Job titles with more than 10 employees\nSELECT JobTitle, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY JobTitle\nHAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 10;\n\n-- 3. Departments with average hire date before 2021\nSELECT DepartmentID, AVG(HireDate) AS AverageHireDate\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY DepartmentID\nHAVING AVG(HireDate) &lt; '2021-01-01';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfusion between WHERE and HAVING Clause”\n\n\n\nThe WHERE clause is used to filter rows before any grouping is done, while the HAVING clause is used to filter groups after the GROUP BY clause has been applied. Use WHERE for individual row conditions and HAVING for aggregated data conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.10 NULL Values\nIn SQL, NULL represents a missing or unknown value. It is important to handle NULL values properly when querying data. You can use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators to check for NULL values in a column. The general syntax for checking NULL values is as follows:\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name\nWHERE column_name IS NULL|IS NOT NULL;\nHere is an example of how to select employees with a NULL value in the ManagerID column:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, ManagerID\nFROM Employees\nWHERE ManagerID IS NULL;\n\n2.2.10.1 Exercises\n\nWrite a query to select employees with a NULL value in the HireDate column.\nWrite a query to select employees with a non-NULL value in the Salary column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n-- 1. Employees with NULL HireDate\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate\nFROM Employees\nWHERE HireDate IS NULL;\n\n-- 2. Employees with non-NULL Salary\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary\nFROM Employees\nWHERE Salary IS NOT NULL;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.11 LIMIT Clause\nThe LIMIT clause is used to specify the maximum number of records to return in the result set. It is useful when you want to retrieve a subset of data from a larger dataset. The general syntax for the LIMIT clause is as follows:\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name\nLIMIT number_of_records;\nHere is an example of how to use the LIMIT clause to select the first 10 employees from the Employees table:\nSELECT *\nFROM Employees\nLIMIT 10;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on SQL Dialects\n\n\n\nNot all SQL databases support the LIMIT clause. For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, you would use the SELECT TOP keyword instead. Use AI to check the syntax for your specific database system.\n\n\n\n2.2.11.1 Exercises\n\nWrite a query to select the first 5 departments from the Departments table.\nWrite a query to select the first 3 employees with the highest salaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n-- 1. First 5 departments\nSELECT *  \nFROM Departments\nLIMIT 5;\n\n-- 2. First 3 employees with highest salaries\nSELECT *\nFROM Employees\nORDER BY Salary DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.12 LIKE Operator\nThe LIKE operator is used in the WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. It is often used with wildcard characters such as % (which represents zero or more characters) and _ (which represents a single character). The general syntax for the LIKE operator is as follows:\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name\nWHERE column_name LIKE pattern;\nHere is an example of how to use the LIKE operator to select employees whose last name starts with ‘S’:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName\nFROM Employees\nWHERE LastName LIKE 'S%';\n\n2.2.12.1 Exercises\n\nWrite a query to select employees whose first name ends with ‘n’.\nWrite a query to select employees whose last name contains ‘ar’.\nWrite a query to select employees whose first name has ‘a’ as the last letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n-- 1. Employees whose first name ends with 'n'\nSELECT FirstName, LastName\nFROM Employees\nWHERE FirstName LIKE '%n';\n\n-- 2. Employees whose last name contains 'ar'\nSELECT FirstName, LastName\nFROM Employees\nWHERE LastName LIKE '%ar%';\n\n-- 3. Employees whose first name has 'a' as the last letter\nSELECT FirstName, LastName\nFROM Employees\nWHERE FirstName LIKE '%a';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.13 IN Operator\nThe IN operator is used in the WHERE clause to filter records based on a list of specified values. It allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause, making it easier to filter data. The general syntax for the IN operator is as follows:\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name\nWHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);\nHere is an example of how to use the IN operator to select employees who work in departments with IDs 1, 2, or 3:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID\nFROM Employees\nWHERE DepartmentID IN (1, 2, 3);\n\n2.2.13.1 Exercises\n\nWrite a query to select employees who have the job titles ‘Manager’, ‘Analyst’, or ‘Developer’.\nWrite a query to select departments located in ‘Sydney’, ‘Melbourne’, or ‘Brisbane’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n-- 1. Employees with job titles 'Manager', 'Analyst', or 'Developer'\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, JobTitle\nFROM Employees\nWHERE JobTitle IN ('Manager', 'Analyst', 'Developer');\n\n-- 2. Departments located in 'Sydney', 'Melbourne', or 'Brisbane'\nSELECT *\nFROM Departments\nWHERE Location IN ('Sydney', 'Melbourne', 'Brisbane');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.14 BETWEEN Operator\nThe BETWEEN operator is used in the WHERE clause to filter records within a specified range. It is inclusive, meaning it includes the boundary values. The general syntax for the BETWEEN operator is as follows:\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name\nWHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;\nHere is an example of how to use the BETWEEN operator to select employees with salaries between 40000 and 80000:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary\nFROM Employees\nWHERE Salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 80000;\n\n2.2.14.1 Exercises\n\nWrite a query to select employees hired between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021.\nWrite a query to select departments with IDs between 2 and 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n-- 1. Employees hired between January 1, 2020, and December 31\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate\nFROM Employees\nWHERE HireDate BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2021-12-\n31';\n\n-- 2. Departments with IDs between 2 and 5\nSELECT *\nFROM Departments\nWHERE DepartmentID BETWEEN 2 AND 5;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.15 Aliases\nAliases are used to give a table or a column a temporary name. This can make your SQL queries easier to read and understand. You can create an alias using the AS keyword. The general syntax for creating an alias is as follows:\nSELECT column_name AS alias_name\nFROM table_name AS alias_name;\nHere is an example of how to use aliases to rename columns in the result set:\nSELECT FirstName AS First_Name, LastName AS Last_Name\nFROM Employees AS E;\nThis SQL selects the FirstName and LastName columns from the Employees table, renaming them as First_Name and Last_Name in the result set. The Employees table is also given an alias of E for easier reference.\n\n2.2.15.1 Exercises\n\nWrite a query to select the DepartmentName column from the Departments table and rename it as Dept_Name.\nWrite a query to select the FirstName and LastName columns from the Employees table and rename them as FName and LName, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n-- 1. Select DepartmentName and rename as Dept_Name\nSELECT DepartmentName AS Dept_Name\nFROM Departments;\n\n-- 2. Select FirstName and LastName and rename as FName and LName\nSELECT FirstName AS FName, LastName AS LName\nFROM Employees;",
