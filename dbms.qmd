# Database Management System

## Introduction

A database management system (DBMS) is a software application that interacts with users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A DBMS provides a systematic way to create, retrieve, update, and manage data. It allows users to define, create, maintain, and control access to the database.

**Why databases are important?:**

- **Data Storage**: Databases provide a structured way to store large amounts of data efficiently.
- **Data Retrieval**: They allow for quick and easy retrieval of data using queries.
- **Data Integrity**: Databases enforce data integrity and consistency through constraints and rules.
- **Data Security**: They provide mechanisms for securing data and controlling access to it.
- **Data Sharing**: Databases enable multiple users to access and share data simultaneously.
- **Data Backup and Recovery**: They provide tools for backing up data and recovering it in case of failure.
- **Data Relationships**: Databases allow for the establishment of relationships between different data entities, enabling complex data modeling.
- **Data Analysis**: They support advanced data analysis and reporting capabilities.
- **Data Scalability**: Databases can handle large volumes of data and can be scaled to accommodate growth.
- **Data Transactions**: They support transactions, ensuring that data operations are completed successfully or rolled back in case of failure.
- **Data Standards**: Databases adhere to industry standards, making it easier to integrate with other systems and applications.
- **Data Performance**: They optimize data access and retrieval for better performance.
- **Data Maintenance**: Databases provide tools for maintaining data quality and consistency over time.
- **Data Auditing**: They support auditing and tracking of data changes for compliance and accountability.

## Why use a DBMS and not a spreadsheet/table?

Spreadsheets are great for small datasets and simple calculations, but they have limitations when it comes to handling large amounts of data, complex relationships, and multi-user access. A DBMS is designed to handle these challenges and provides a more robust solution for data management.

## Why not Excel?

Excel is a easy to use tool for data analysis and visualization, but it is not designed to be a full-fledged database management system. While Excel can be used for small datasets and simple calculations, a DBMS is a better choice for larger datasets and more complex data management needs. For example, in a large banking system, a DBMS would be used to manage customer accounts, transactions, and other data, while Excel might be used for simple reporting or analysis tasks. To deal with single large dataset, a DBMS is more efficient and effective than Excel. For example, a DBMS can handle millions of records and complex queries, while Excel may struggle with performance and data integrity issues. Also, when we need to joins multiple tables together, a DBMS provides powerful tools for managing relationships between tables, while Excel is limited in this regard. Imagine a bank store all the customers data in Excel, it would be very difficult to manage and retrieve the data efficiently. A DBMS would provide a more structured and efficient way to manage the data.

## Difference between using DBMS and Excel

| Feature | DBMS | Excel |
|---------|------|-------|
| Data Storage | Structured and efficient | Flat and less efficient |
| Data Retrieval | Fast and optimized | Slower for large datasets |
| Data Integrity | Enforced through constraints | Limited data validation |
| Data Security | Advanced security features | Basic password protection |
| Data Sharing | Multi-user access | Limited multi-user support |
| Data Relationships | Supports complex relationships | Limited to simple relationships |
| Data Scalability | Scalable for large datasets | Limited scalability |
| Data Maintenance | Tools for data quality | Manual maintenance |
| Data Auditing | Supports auditing | No built-in auditing |
| Data Performance | Optimized for performance | Slower for large datasets |
| Data Standards | Adheres to industry standards | No standardization |
| Data Backup | Automated backup options | Manual backup required |
| Data Recovery | Automated recovery options | Manual recovery required |

## What is Relational Database (RDBMS)?

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity or concept, and the columns represent the attributes or properties of that entity. The rows in the table represent individual records or instances of the entity. It allows for the establishment of relationships between different tables using keys, enabling complex data modeling and retrieval. Figure 1 illustrates a simple relational database with four tables: Drivers License, Member, Rental, Movie_Rental and Movie. Each table has its own set of columns and rows, and the relationships between the tables are established using primary and foreign keys. (we will cover keys later).

## What is the relationship between SQL vs. RDBMS?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is the standard language for interacting with a RDBMS. SQL allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in a database. A RDBMS is the software that implements the database and provides the interface for users to interact with it using SQL.

## Why SQL is important for a data analyst?

SQL is important because it provides a standardized way to interact with relational databases. It allows users to perform complex queries, retrieve data, and manipulate data in a consistent manner. SQL is widely used in the industry and is supported by most relational database management systems (RDBMS). Learning SQL is essential for anyone working with databases, as it enables them to effectively manage and analyze data. Additionally, SQL skills are highly sought after in the job market, making it a valuable asset for data analysts.

# Structured Query Language (SQL)

## What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used to perform various operations on the data stored in a database, such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data. SQL is widely used in the industry and is supported by most relational database management systems (RDBMS), including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. The standard language for different RDBMS may have slight variations, but the core SQL syntax and functionality remain consistent across platforms. In this course, we will focus on using Oracle as our RDBMS. Oracle is chosen as it is widely used in the industry and provides a robust platform for learning SQL and database management concepts.

SQL is a declarative language, meaning that users specify what they want to do with the data, rather than how to do it. This allows for more efficient and optimized execution of queries by the database engine. SQL is also a powerful language that supports complex queries, joins, aggregations, and subqueries, making it suitable for a wide range of data analysis tasks.

## Basic SQL Commands

There are several types of SQL commands, each serving a different purpose. The main categories of SQL commands are:

- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Used to manipulate data in the database.  
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used to define and manage the structure of the database.  
- **Data Query Language (DQL)**: Used to query and retrieve data from the database.  

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands are used to manipulate data in the database. They include commands for inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.

- **INSERT**: Used to add new rows of data to a table.
- **UPDATE**: Used to modify existing data in a table.
- **DELETE**: Used to remove rows of data from a table.

### Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL commands are used to define and manage the structure of the database. They include commands for creating, altering, and dropping database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.

- **CREATE**: Used to create a new database object (e.g., table, index).
- **ALTER**: Used to modify an existing database object (e.g., add or drop columns).
- **DROP**: Used to delete an existing database object (e.g., table, index).
- **TRUNCATE**: Used to delete all rows from a table without removing the table itself.
- **RENAME**: Used to rename an existing database object (e.g., table, column).
- **COMMENT**: Used to add comments to database objects (e.g., tables, columns).
- **CREATE INDEX**: Used to create an index on a table to improve query performance.
- **DROP INDEX**: Used to delete an existing index from a table.
- **CREATE VIEW**: Used to create a virtual table based on the result of a query.
- **DROP VIEW**: Used to delete an existing view from the database.
- **CREATE TABLE**: Used to create a new table in the database.
- **ALTER TABLE**: Used to modify the structure of an existing table (e.g., add or drop columns).
- **DROP TABLE**: Used to delete an existing table from the database.

## Data Query Language (DQL)

DQL commands are used to query and retrieve data from the database. The main DQL command is:
- **SELECT**: Used to retrieve data from one or more tables in the database.
- **WHERE**: Used to filter the results of a query based on specified conditions.
- **ORDER BY**: Used to sort the results of a query in ascending or descending order
- **GROUP BY**: Used to group the results of a query based on specified columns.
- **HAVING**: Used to filter the results of a grouped query based on specified conditions
- **JOIN**: Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
- **UNION**: Used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries into a
single result set.
- **DISTINCT**: Used to retrieve unique values from a column, eliminating duplicate values.
- **LIMIT**: Used to limit the number of rows returned by a query.

All these keywords will be explained in the next sections. 🔮
