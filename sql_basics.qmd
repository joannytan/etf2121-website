# SQL Basics

SQL follows a standard syntax for managing and manipulating relational databases. Below are some fundamental SQL commands and examples to help you get started.

The general structure of an SQL statement is as follows:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

The `select` statement is used to retrieve data from a database, while the `from` clause specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. The `where` clause is optional and is used to filter the results based on a specified condition. These are SQL keywords and are not case-sensitive, but it is common practice to write them in uppercase for better readability. Also, they should end with a semicolon (`;`) to indicate the end of the statement.

## Creating a Table

To create a table in SQL, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Here is an example of how to create a simple table called `Employees` with columns for `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `HireDate`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    HireDate DATE
);
```
## Inserting Data

To insert data into a table, you can use the `INSERT INTO` statement. Here is an example of how to insert a new employee into the `Employees` table:
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '2022-01-15');
```

## Querying Data

To retrieve data from a table, you can use the `SELECT` statement. Here is an example of how to select all columns from the `Employees` table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

## Updating Data

To update existing data in a table, you can use the `UPDATE` statement. Here is an example of how to update the last name of an employee in the `Employees` table:
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET LastName = 'Smith'
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
```

## Deleting Data

To delete data from a table, you can use the `DELETE` statement. Here is an example of how to delete an employee from the `Employees` table:
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
```

#### Exercises

1. Create a table called `Departments` with columns for `DepartmentID`, `DepartmentName`, and `Location`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100),
    Location VARCHAR(100)
);
```

2. Insert three departments into the `Departments` table with appropriate values.
```sql
INSERT INTO Departments (DepartmentID, DepartmentName, Location)
VALUES
(1, 'Human Resources', 'Sydney'),
(2, 'Finance', 'Melbourne'),
(3, 'IT', 'Brisbane');
```
3. Write a query to select all departments located in 'Melbourne'.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Departments
WHERE Location = 'Melbourne';
```
4. Update the location of department to 'Queensland'.
```sql
UPDATE Departments
SET Location = 'Queensland'
WHERE DepartmentID = 3;
```
5. Delete a department with a specific `DepartmentID`.
```sql
DELETE FROM Departments
WHERE DepartmentID = 2;
```
